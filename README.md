# Overview

## What is Vultisig

🙋‍♀️ Vultisig is a multi-chain, multi-factor, multi-platform Threshold-Signature vault that does not need any specialised hardware. It supports most UTXO, EVM, BFT and EdDSA Chains.\
It is based on [Binance tss-lib](https://github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib/tree/master), but adapted for the mobile environment.

Vultisig is built by the founders of [THORChain](https://thorchain.org) - who built the largest and oldest working multi-chain DEX with Threshold-signatures.

## How can it be used?

It is possible to create a vault with different secure setup options:

#### Ease of use options:

* Fast Vaults (One device solution, "hot wallet")
* Active Vaults (Two device solution, "main wallet")

#### Self Custodial options:

* 2 of 2 (fastest setup, not backed up\*)
* 2 of 3 (recommended, backed up\*)
* 3 of 4 (most secure)

_The above are the most popular vault configurations and more can come in the future._\\

## Why

🔮 Vultisigs are better than Single-sig or Multi-sig Wallets:

* Vultisig vault shares do not store funds - thus no funds at risk if you lose a key.
* &#x20;There is no on-chain registration of signing-keys.
* Vultisigs are compatible with all chains and fully DeFi compatible (Multi-sigs are not).

📱 Vultisig uses your favourite laptops, tablets, and phones.

* Rich, large screens with familiar UI, Secure Enclaves to store vault shares and with biometric locking.
* &#x20;Does not look like a hardware device and therefore grants higher security.

🌈 Vultisig is open-source, based on secure technology and is audited (see in [security.md](threshold-signature-scheme/security.md "mention"), _with further audits to come_).\
**There is no registration required.**

## Who should use it

Everyone should use it!\
It is far safer than anything else (mobile, desktop, hardware, etc).

Vultisig is a ever expanding Ecosystem. Working on more platforms, products and features.

\_\*\_backed up: meaning that a device can be lost and access to funds is still ensured. Deleting the application is equivalent to losing the device. To properly back up the vault shares, please use the [following steps](user-actions/managing-your-vault/vault-backup.md).
