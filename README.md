# Overview

## What

🙋‍♀️ Vultisig is a multi-chain multi-platform Threshold-Signature vault that does not need any specialised hardware. It supports most UTXO, EVM, BFT and EdDSA Chains. It is based on [Binance tss-lib](https://github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib/tree/master), but adapted for the mobile environment.

Vultisig is built by the founders of [THORChain](https://thorchain.org) - who built the largest and oldest working multi-chain DEX with Threshold-signatures.

## How

Create a vault:

* 2 of 2 (fastest setup, not backed up)
* 2 of 3 (recommended, backed up)
* 3 of 4 (most secure)

*The above are the most popular vault configurations.*

## Why

🔮 Threshold-Sig Vaults are better than Single-Sig or Multi-sig Wallets:

Vault shares do not store funds - thus no funds at risk if you lose a key. There is no on-chain registration of signing-keys. Threshold-Sigs are compatible on all chains (Multi-sigs are not) Threshold-Sigs are fully DeFi compatible (Multi-sigs are not) 📱 Vultisig uses your favourite Laptops, Tablets and Phones.

Rich, large screens with familiar UI Secure Enclaves to store vault shares, with biometric locking. Does not look a hardware device (not a honeypot) 🌈 Vultisig is open-source, based on secure technology and is audited (link soon). There is no registration required.

## Who should use it

Everyone should use it. It is far safer than anything else (mobile, desktop, hardware, etc).
