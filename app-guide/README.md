# App Guide

The Vultisig app is organized into two main sections, accessible via the bottom navigation bar: **Wallet** and **DeFi**. This guide covers all app functionality in the same structure as the app itself.

***

## App Structure

| Tab | Purpose | Key Features |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| **Wallet** | Asset management and transactions | Send, receive, swap across 30+ chains |
| **DeFi** | Decentralized finance operations | Stake, bond, provide liquidity, earn yield |

Additional functionality is available through **Vault Management** in the settings menu.

## Sections

### Creating a Vault

Set up your first vault with either Fast Vault (single device) or Secure Vault (multi-device).

[creating-a-vault](creating-a-vault/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Wallet

The Wallet tab provides asset management capabilities: viewing balances, sending crypto, receiving funds, and swapping between assets.

{% content-ref url="wallet/" %}
[wallet](wallet/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### DeFi

The DeFi tab offers direct access to decentralized finance protocols. Users can stake tokens, bond to nodes, provide liquidity, and earn yield—all without connecting to external dApps.

{% content-ref url="defi/" %}
[defi](defi/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Vault Management

Vault settings and maintenance: backups, renaming, resharing keys, and security upgrades.

{% content-ref url="vault-management/" %}
[vault-management](vault-management/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
