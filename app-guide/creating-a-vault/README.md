# Creating a Vault

Vultisig vaults are multi-factor by nature, requiring coordination between multiple signing parties. There are two vault types designed to meet different user needs: from a convenient "hot wallet" option to a highly secure "cold wallet" configuration.

Creating a vault is also called a Key Generation (KeyGen) event. See [TSS Actions](../../security-technology/tss-actions.md) for technical details.

## After Creation

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Always backup your vault immediately after creation.**

Without proper backups, device loss means permanent loss of access to funds. See [Backup & Recovery](../../getting-started/backup-recovery.md).
