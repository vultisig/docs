## Vault Backup Verification

{% hint style="info" %}
**Verify your backups exist** — ensure you have backed up all vault shares at least once. After initial backup, you only need to create new backups after a [reshare operation](vault-reshare.md). See [Backup & Recovery](../../getting-started/backup-recovery.md) for best practices.
{% endhint %}
