# Sending

Vultisig supports sending assets on all integrated blockchains. Transactions are secured using threshold signatures—no single device ever holds the complete private key.

***

## How to Send

1. **Select the asset** from your vault's asset list
2. **Tap "Send"** to enter the send flow
3. **Enter the recipient address** — paste or scan a QR code
4. **Enter the amount** — tap "Max" to send the full balance
5. **Review the transaction** including network fee
6. **Sign with your devices** — bring your threshold of devices together
7. **Transaction broadcasts** automatically after successful signing

## Supported Chains

Sending is supported on all integrated blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, THORChain, and 30+ others.

## Tips

- **Double-check the recipient address** — blockchain transactions are irreversible
- **Ensure sufficient balance** for network fees (gas)
- **Use QR scanning** when possible to avoid address typos
- **For large amounts**, send a small test transaction first
