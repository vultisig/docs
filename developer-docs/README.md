# Developer Docs

Build on Vultisig's secure, multi-chain infrastructure. Whether you're creating automated trading strategies, integrating wallet connectivity into your dApp, or building applications with programmatic vault management, Vultisig provides the tools you need.

## What Can You Build?

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Automated Trading** | DCA bots, yield optimizers, portfolio rebalancers |
| **AI Agents** | Autonomous trading agents with secure key management |
| **dApp Wallet Integration** | Connect Vultisig to your DeFi protocol or NFT marketplace |
| **Custodial Services** | Multi-sig treasury management, institutional custody |
| **Portfolio Apps** | Cross-chain portfolio trackers with transaction capabilities |

These are just examples. Vultisig's MPC infrastructure is chain-agnostic and protocol-agnostic—if it exists on-chain, you can automate it. Get creative.
