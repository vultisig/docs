# Create Your First Vault

A vault is your secure container for crypto assets. Vultisig uses Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) technology - your private key is never stored in one place.

## Choose Your Vault Type

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards">
<thead>

<th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Fast Vault</strong></td>
<td>Single device + Vultisig server</td>
<td>Best for: Getting started, smaller amounts, convenience</td>
<td><a href="../app-guide/creating-a-vault/fast-vault.md">fast-vault.md</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Secure Vault</strong></td>
<td>2+ devices you control</td>
<td>Best for: Maximum security, larger amounts, no trusted third party</td>

## Recommended Configurations

**For beginners:**
- Start with a **Fast Vault** to learn the app
- Upgrade to Secure Vault later for larger amounts

**For security-conscious users:**
- **2-of-2**: Two devices, both required to sign (no backup device)
- **2-of-3**: Three devices, any two can sign (recommended - has backup)
- **3-of-4**: Four devices, any three can sign (maximum security)

{% hint style="success" %}
**2-of-3 is the sweet spot** - secure enough for most users, with a backup device in case one is lost.
{% endhint %}

## After Creating Your Vault

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Immediately backup your vault!**

This is the most important step. Without a backup, you could lose access to your funds if a device is lost or damaged.
