# Your First Transaction

Your vault is created and backed up. Now let's move some crypto!

***

## Receiving Crypto

### Get Your Address

1. Open your vault in Vultisig
2. Tap on the asset you want to receive (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum)
3. Tap **Receive** or the QR code icon
4. Copy the address or share the QR code

{% hint style="info" %}
Each blockchain has its own address. Your Bitcoin address is different from your Ethereum address.
{% endhint %}

### Deposit From

- Another wallet you own
- An exchange (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc.)
- A friend sending you crypto

***

## Sending Crypto

### Step-by-Step

1. **Select the asset** you want to send from your vault
2. **Tap "Send"**
3. **Enter the recipient address** - paste or scan QR code
4. **Enter the amount** - or tap "Max" for everything
5. **Review the transaction** - check address, amount, and fee
6. **Sign with your devices** - bring your threshold of devices together
7. **Done!** - transaction broadcasts automatically

### Tips

- **Double-check the address** - crypto transactions are irreversible
- **Start small** - send a test transaction first for large amounts
- **Have enough for fees** - keep some native token (ETH, BTC, SOL) for gas

## The Signing Process

This is where Vultisig's security shines:

1. **Initiate** - Start the transaction on one device
2. **Pair** - Other device(s) scan the QR code or connect via relay
3. **Review** - All devices show the same transaction details
4. **Approve** - Each device approves independently
5. **Sign** - Threshold signatures combine to create a valid transaction
6. **Broadcast** - Transaction is sent to the blockchain

{% hint style="success" %}
**No single device ever has the full private key.** Even if one device is compromised, your funds remain safe.
{% endhint %}
