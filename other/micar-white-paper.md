# MiCAR White Paper

Vulti Holdings Limited has voluntarily submitted a MiCA-compliant whitepaper for the VULT token (VULT), which is classified as an “Other Crypto-Asset” under Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). Unlike Asset-Referenced Tokens (ARTs), Electronic Money Tokens (EMTs), or Utility Tokens, VULT is not subject to a mandatory whitepaper requirement. \
However, pursuant to Article 6(1), second subparagraph of MiCA, service providers may voluntarily publish a whitepaper to promote transparency, regulatory clarity, and investor confidence. This document provides key disclosures regarding VULT’s characteristics, associated risks, and the exemptions though decentralization to the regulatory framework under which VULT can be offered within the EU/EEA.
