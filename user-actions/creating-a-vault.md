# Creating a Vault

### Setup

You first need to download the Voltix App to 2, 3 or 4 devices.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently only Macbook (M1), iPad and iPhones are supported. Find the app in the app stores (for Mac, look under "iPad Apps")
{% endhint %}

### Vault Types

You can choose the following vaults:

1. **2 of 2 vault** - only need two to create a vault and two to sign a transaction. Note, it is not automatically "redundant" so you absolutely should export the vault shares and store them separately and securely. This will be the most popular vault type since it is the most convenient.&#x20;
2. **2 of 3 vault** - three devices to create a vault and two to sign a transaction. This is automatically backed (one device is the backup) so you don't need to export vault shares. But you may choose to do this.&#x20;
3. **3 of 4 vault** - four devices to create a vault and three to sign a transaction. This is automatically backed (one device is the backup) so you don't need to export vault shares. But you may choose to do this.&#x20;
