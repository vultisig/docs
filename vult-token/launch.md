# Launch of $VULT

> **Last updated:** 2025‑10‑20 - reflects the “Token Launch Update and New Principles for Community Communication” Medium post. [Read the full announcement](https://vultisig.medium.com/token-launch-update-and-new-principles-for-community-communication-a57898b5614e).

## TL;DR / FAQ

**Launch window:** _27th of October 2025_. The DEX launch will occur **24 hours&#x20;**_**before**_**&#x20;our CEX listing**.

* **DEX → CEX cadence:** DEX launches **24 hours before the CEX listing**.
* **Liquidity & pricing:** \~35% of supply seeded in a Uniswap V3 pool starting at \~$3M FDV.
* **Whitelist: Up to** 1,500 slots with staggered purchase caps ($1k first hour → $10k thereafter).
* **IOU VULT holders:** $VULT will be claimable shortly after the launch.

***

Our CEX partners determine their own go‑live schedule. Once our CEX partner publicly confirms their listing schedule, we will coordinate transparently and clearly communicate the DEX launch date. Committing prematurely has already created confusion, so we are moving to an evidence‑based timeline:

1. Confirmed date with CEX.
2. We subtract 24 h from the confirmed CEX listing date and lock that in as the DEX launch time - meaning you’ll know the DEX launch timing as soon as the CEX date is announced.
3. Announcement will happen with enough due time (1-2 weeks) until launch but as soon as date is set.
4. Joint marketing push‑up with the CEX + Vultisquad until launch.

This approach guarantees we never miss a published date again and keeps the community first in the information flow.
