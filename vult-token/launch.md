# Launch

## TLDR/FAQ

* Launch will be on Ethereum mainnet
* Max WL buy is 4 ETH (value \~$10k Dollar)  or WETH (either ETH or WETH can be used)
* The launch will happen when specific milestones are met
* Token Allocation will be specified closer to actual launch

## Launch Liquidity

#### **Initial Funding**

Vultisig has raised $2.4 million from outside investors. A portion of this capital will be used to pair against the $VULT tokens in a UNI V3 liquidity pool. By using the concentrated liquidity and range setting of UNI V3, the capital will be deployed in a range of $2.5 million to $10 billion FDV.\
This gives the opportunity to use the capital efficiently and deploy it in the required ranges to efficiently deploy the token on launch day.

**Initial Valuation**

This setup gives us the possibility to launch at a **fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $3 million**.

#### **Whitelisted Trade-Only Period**

The next phase after launch is a 24-hour trade-only period for whitelisted (WL) addresses. Here are the key points:

* The trade-only period operates on a first-come, first-served basis among WL addresses.
* Each WL address can make multiple purchases, but the total cannot exceed 4 ETH.
* Sell transactions are allowed, but only whitelisted addresses that have already bought $VULT tokens will have any to sell.

#### **Open Trading**

After the 24-hour whitelisted period, the pool will be open for unlimited buy and sell transactions.

#### **Launch**&#x20;

The launch will take place on the [Krystal ILO](https://ilo.krystal.app/) platform and Uniswap with a 24-hour whitelisting period. The launch mechanics may be similar to the launch of [$WEWE](https://ilo.krystal.app/project/upside-dow-wewe-690447).

## Further Information

* The parties with 12-month cliff will not be able to withdraw from the Liquidity Pool during the vesting period. However, $VULT can still be freely bought/sold through the Liquidity Pool.
* The first buy during the WL launch will be at $3m Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV).
* The launch pool will be on Uniswap V3, with a 1% swap fee setting.
