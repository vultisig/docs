description: The purpose of the Vultisig Token
---

# $VULT

Vultisig fulfils four important purposes:

1. To raise capital to accelerate the product during its bootstrap phase
2. To buy users and AUM as quickly as possible using an Airdrop
3. To provide incentives to contributors to build the product
4. To allow anyone to support the adoption trajectory of the product

## The Vultisig Token $VULT

* 100,000,000 starting supply
* 70% in launch liquidity
* 10% for the WEWE-VULT merge on Base
* 20% allocated to an airdrop
* ERC20 with ERC777 extensions: `approveAndCall()` and `_beforeTransferHook()`
* Ownable, but not mintable (to set launch params)
* Burnable

## Value Accrual

The Vultisig $VULT token will accrue direct USDC revenue to the user when staked, coming from the fees generated by Vultisig. \
The more swaps and bridging that happen in Vultisig, the higher the real yield will be.
