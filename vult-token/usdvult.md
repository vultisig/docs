# The $VULT token

## Utility of $VULT token

The primary benefit comes through a Tier system that gives $VULT holders reduced trading fees and the staking mechanism, where $VULT holders will be able stake their tokens to earn direct $USDC cash-back rewards generated from ecosystem activity.

Beyond passive income opportunities, $VULT unlocks preferential pricing and exclusive access to premium features across the Vultisig marketplace. As our ecosystem grows, so too will the utility and value proposition of holding VULT tokens.

Furthermore, the Vultisig token $VULT serves four important purposes:

1. To raise capital to accelerate the product during its bootstrap phase
2. To buy users and AUM as quickly as possible using an Airdrop
3. To provide incentives to contributors to build the product
4. To allow anyone to support the adoption trajectory of the product

### Trading Fee Tiers

The $VULT token can be held in the Vultisig Vaults to receive in-app swap fee discounts. The Tiers are the following:
