# The $VULT token

## Utility of $VULT token

The primary benefit comes through the staking mechanism, where $VULT holders will be able stake their tokens to earn direct $USDC cashback rewards generated from ecosystem activity.

Beyond passive income opportunities, $VULT unlocks preferential pricing and exclusive access to premium features across the Vultisig marketplace. As our ecosystem grows, so too will the utility and value proposition of holding VULT tokens.

Furthermore, the Vultisig token $VULT serves four important purposes:

1. To raise capital to accelerate the product during its bootstrap phase
2. To buy users and AUM as quickly as possible using an Airdrop
3. To provide incentives to contributors to build the product
4. To allow anyone to support the adoption trajectory of the product

## The $VULT Tokenomics

* 100,000,000 maximum supply
* ERC20 with ERC777 extensions: `approveAndCall()` and `_beforeTransferHook()`
* Ownable, but not mintable (to set launch params)
* Burnable

### **Launch Liquidity Allocation:**

* 11% of $VULT tokens come from the project Treasury and will be carefully managed for specific growth initiatives but intended to stay in the LP.

The Treasury allocation remains partially unlocked to fund exceptional opportunities that drive Vultisig adoption, including strategic partnerships, community giveaways, and hackathons. \
All Treasury token usage will be strictly limited to initiatives that directly increase Vultisig ecosystem value.
