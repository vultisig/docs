# Creating a Vault

## Overview

Vultisig vaults are multi-factor by nature, meaning that at least **2 devices** are required to create a vault.

There are different types of vaults that can be created in the Vultisig App, designed to meet all users' needs and configuration preferences. From a 'hot wallet' option to a 'cold wallet' option, users have full flexibility in creation and modification afterward.

Creating a Vault is also called a Key Generation (KeyGen) event, see more information [here](../../threshold-signature-scheme/tss-actions.md#key-generation).
