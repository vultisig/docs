# Secure Vault

## Overview

This setup offers the highest level of security and is considered the 'cold wallet' equivalent in the Vultisig App.

**Secure Vaults consist solely of user devices.**

Users need at least two devices, although minimum three is recommended. More devices can be added to their vaults, increasing the signing threshold and enhancing security with each additional device.

This option is also ideal for shared wallets among multiple users and DAOs.

***

The vaults will have a `m`-of-`n` Threshold to sign transactions, where `m` is at least 2/3rds (Threshold is 67%) of `n`, and no maximum number of `n` devices.&#x20;

The following are the most common vault setups:

1. **2-of-3 vault** - three devices to create a vault and two devices can sign a transaction.\
   This vault is automatically redundant, which means you can lose one device and still have access to your vault. To make sure you are fully protected, please [back up](../managing-your-vault/vault-backup.md) the Vault shares of every device.\
   **This vault type is recommended as a secure vault setup.**
2. **3-of-4 vault** - four devices to create a vault and three devices to sign a transaction.\
   This vault is automatically redundant, which means you can lose one device and still have access to your vault. To make sure you are fully protected, please [back up](../managing-your-vault/vault-backup.md) the Vault shares of every device.
3. **2-of-2 vault** - two devices to create a vault and two devices to sign a transaction.\
   This vault is vunerable if you lose one device, you can lose access to the funds.\
   To make sure you are fully protected, please [back up](../managing-your-vault/vault-backup.md) the Vault shares of every device.\
   **This vault type is not recommended as a secure vault setup.**

What is the most redundant vault that allows you maximum flexibility?

Try this:\
1\) Use 3 different builds (Mac, iOS, Android) on 3 different devices.

2\) Export vaults shares with 3 different passwords to encrypt.

3\) Save vault shares in 3 different Cloud Storage options (Google, iCloud, Proton, Dropbox etc), each with a unique email address per Cloud Storage.

4\) Ensure each email has 2FA.\
\
To compromise this vault, an attacker would need to\
\
1\) Break into 2 different emails, intercept your 2FA, AND crack 2 different passwords, or\
2\) Compromise 2 different devices (get past passcodes and biometrics).

If you practice good security, the likelihood of this is significantly low, almost zero. (How many times has someone broken into 1 of your devices/email/storage accounts, let alone 2).

The advantage of this setup is you can re-spawn anywhere in the world with just your email accounts and passwords, without carrying around hardware wallets and seed-phrases.

## Creating a Secure Vault

* Download Vultisig and get your devices ready. You will need:
  * One initiating device
  * Multiple pairing devices

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Select Secure Vault option on one device, this will be the initiating device.

* **Initiating device: Next** -> Select a vault name. -> it will show a QR Code to scan with your pairing device(s)

* **Pairing Devices:** Select "Scan QR code" and scan the QR code from the main device

* When all wanted pairing devices are present, create the vault with the `Next` button on the initiating device.

### Network Types

You can choose Internet or WiFI.

1. **Internet:** Using the Vultisig relay server. Encrypted packages are routed through the Vultisig relay server over the Internet. Each device can be on different networks / Internet providers.
2. **Local**: Using local Wi-Fi Network, however may not work on some Wi-Fi networks (since they may block mDNS packets).

The Vault Creation step may fail if the Internet/network connection is not stable.

### Keygen/Vault creation

Once you click NEXT, the keygen process will begin. First it will create the pre-parameters (your vault shares and some other aspects, about 5 seconds), then it will create the ECDSA and EdDSA keys (another 5 seconds).\
\
Finally, it is done! Make sure that all devices show the done screen.

### Backups

Follow the onboarding process to back up each device and its shares. To ensure constant access to your funds, keep backups of each device at all times.\
\
Read more about Backups and their storage [here](../managing-your-vault/vault-backup.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
After creating a vault, **ALWAYS** [back up](../managing-your-vault/vault-backup.md) **every** device.
