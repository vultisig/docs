{% hint style="warning" %}
**The Vault QR is NOT a backup for the respective Vault.**\
It is only a tool to share public keys easily and securely.
{% endhint %}

## Why it is needed?

With the Vault QR, the public keys of a Vault can be easily imported into other interfaces without the risk of exposing sensitive information, which could lead to loss of funds or potential exploits.

This is a safe way to share and import Vultisig Vaults without using seed phrases.

## How to export the Vault QR?

You can find the export of the QR code on the main screen in the top right corner, afterwards it can be saved or shared for further use.
