# Functions

Vultisig supports advanced DeFi actions, or functions. They allow users to access their favorite DeFi apps directly within the app with just a few clicks, eliminating the need to connect to a dApp or send funds outside of a secure environment.

{% hint style="info" %}
Vultisig is constantly expanding its functionality. More support will be added over time.
