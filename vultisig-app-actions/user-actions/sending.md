# Sending

Vultisig supports sending assets on all integrated blockchains. Transactions are secured using threshold signatures, meaning no single device ever holds the complete private key.

***

## How to Send

1. **Select the asset** you want to send from your vault's asset list
2. **Tap the "Send" button** to enter the send flow
3. **Enter the recipient address** - paste or scan a QR code
4. **Enter the amount** - you can also tap "Max" to send all
5. **Review the transaction details** including network fee
6. **Initiate [signing](../signing-a-transaction/signing-a-transaction.md)** with your threshold of devices
7. **Transaction broadcasts** automatically after successful signing

## Supported Chains

Sending is supported on all [integrated blockchains](../../FAQ/#what-chains-are-supported-by-vultisig), including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, THORChain, and 30+ others.

***

## Tips

* **Double-check the recipient address** - blockchain transactions are irreversible
* **Ensure sufficient balance** for network fees (gas)
* **Use QR scanning** when possible to avoid address typos
* **For large amounts**, consider sending a small test transaction first
