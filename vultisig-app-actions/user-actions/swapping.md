# Swapping

Vultisig supports swapping assets on many integrated blockchains, expanding the swap support constantly. The "Swap" button can be used to access the "Swap" flow.

Currently the following Swap Providers are integrated and used to facilitate cross-chain swaps:

* [THORChain](https://thorchain.org/)
* [MAYA Protocol](https://www.mayaprotocol.com/)
* [1inch](https://1inch.io/)
* [Li.Fi](https://li.fi/)
* [Kyberswap](https://kyberswap.com)
