# App Store

{% hint style="warning" %}
The App Store is still getting developed and will be available soon
{% endhint %}

## Overview

The Vultisig App Store is a living ecosystem where innovation meets utility, connecting builders and users in a vibrant open-source community.

Developers can create, distribute, and monetize cutting-edge plugins and AI agents, while users benefit from powerful tools that enhance and automate their digital asset management.

***

## What are Apps?

Vultisig apps are vault automation workflows created by Vultisig or third-party developers that archive automatic on-chain interactions for users. Due to Vultisig's use of MPC technology, these apps are not limited by any specific chain, action, or protocol interaction. This gives developers the freedom to design secure, self-custodial automations without giving up private keys or granting full access to wallet funds.

## For Developers

Developers can unleash their creativity by creating custom workflows and intelligent agents, and earn direct revenue from their creations.

The App Store fosters continuous improvement and community development through an interactive review and feedback mechanism, ensuring the highest possible quality solutions while rewarding innovative builders. This creates a self-sustaining ecosystem where value is transferred between creators and users, driving the growth of decentralized finance automation.

Whether you're a developer looking to monetize your skills or a user looking to enhance your crypto management capabilities, the Vultisig Marketplace is your gateway to the future of digital asset management automation.
