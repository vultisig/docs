## What are Apps?

Vultisig apps are vault automation workflows created by Vultisig or third-party developers that archive automatic on-chain interactions for users. Due to Vultisig's use of MPC technology, these apps are not limited by any specific chain, action, or protocol interaction. This gives developers the freedom to design secure, self-custodial automations without giving up private keys or granting full access to wallet funds.

Developers are able to unleash their creativity by making custom workflows and intelligent agents, earning direct revenue from their work.\
Users benefit from a curated toolbox of trustworthy tools, ranging from automated trading strategies to sophisticated portfolio management solutions, integrated with Vultisig's secure infrastructure.

Through an interactive review and feedback mechanism, the marketplace fosters continuous improvement and community development, ensuring the highest possible quality solutions while rewarding innovative builders. This creates a self-sustaining ecosystem where value is transferred between creators and users, driving the growth of decentralized finance automation.

Whether you're a developer looking to commercialize your expertise or a user looking to expand your crypto management capabilities, the Vultisig Marketplace is your gateway to the future of digital asset management automation."
