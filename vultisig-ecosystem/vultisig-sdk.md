# Vultisig SDK

Vultisig aims to create a vibrant and widely adopted [marketplace](marketplace.md); to achieve this, the Vultisig team created the Vultisig SDK to seamlessly enable Ai agent builders to tap into the seedless, cross-chain, trust-minimized technology that powers Vultisig Vaults.\
\
The SDK opens two powerful paths for builders:&#x20;

* Create fully or partially autonomous agents that operate independently across multiple chains, or create intelligent assistants that enhance existing vault setups - requiring user approval for actions or performing approved operations autonomously.
* Create plugins that automate the workflow only within the limits set by the creator. For example, the DCA plugins.

By removing old limitations and technical boundaries, the Vultisig SDK is a quantum leap in the field. Developers can now build fully cross-chain agent-based systems that combine the security of MPC technology with the intelligence of AI, ushering in a new age of automated, secure and intelligent digital asset management.
