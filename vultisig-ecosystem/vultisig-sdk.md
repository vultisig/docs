# Vultisig SDK

Vultisig aims to make Web3 safer and provide access to its technology. To achieve this, the Vultisig team created the Vultisig SDK, which enables developers to easily access cross-chain, multi-factor technology powered by Vultisig.\
\
The SDK opens powerful possibilities for developers:

* Add Vultisig technology to existing seedphrase-based wallets
* Add Vultisig technology to your web application to easily onboard users to Web3
* Add Vultisig technology to coding environments without storing toxic seed phrases

By removing old limitations and technical boundaries, the Vultisig SDK is a quantum leap in the field.&#x20;

Developers can now build web3 applications to onboard users into a seed-less, cross-chain world that combine the security of MPC technology and ease of  use for both developers and users
