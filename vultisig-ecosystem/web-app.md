# Web App

The web app is a "view-only" version of all Vultisig Vaults, giving DAOs and Treasuries the perfect tool to share their holdings without fear that any stakeholder will be able to access the assets.

It is also used to display the ongoing [airdrop](../vultisig-token/airdrop/) of $VULT to the community.

The website can be accessed here:
