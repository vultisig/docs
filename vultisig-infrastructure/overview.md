  Vultisig infrastructure: Vultiserver for auto-signing and Relay Server
  for secure device communication. Trustless design, no tracking.
---

# Overview

Vultisig aims to be as trustless as possible while still providing the best service possible.

To achieve this, Vultisig doesn't use any tracking or data collection in-app, see more here.

Nevertheless, it provides two solutions to improve the user experience, which are the Vultiserver and the Relay-Server:

{% content-ref url="what-is-vultisigner/" %}
[what-is-vultisigner](what-is-vultisigner/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="relay-server.md" %}
[relay-server.md](relay-server.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
