# Relay Server

The Vultisig Relay Server is an infrastructure feature of Vultisig that enables encrypted messaging between user devices over the Internet.&#x20;

The Vultisig Relay Server is nothing more than a messaging service to ensure efficient and smooth messaging between devices that have Vultisig installed.

&#x20;It relays all Keygen and Keysign messages from collaborating user devices completely end-to-end encrypted so that no other party can intercept the information being passed.

See the code [here](https://github.com/vultisig/vultisig-relay).
