## What are Vultisig Referrals

Vultisig Referrals uses [THORChain Nested Affiliates](https://dev.thorchain.org/affiliate-guide/affiliate-fee-guide.html) to redistribute a portion of swap fees back to users.

## What do Vultisig users gain?

* Users who refer others — *referrers* — earn 10 basis points (0.10%) on each referred swap.
* Users who use a referral code save 5 basis points (0.05%) on each swap.

## How do they work?

When a swap is made, the app creates a memo for the swap on THORChain. This memo includes the user's chosen affiliate and redistributes the fees directly to the affiliate's owner.

## How to manage the Vultisig Referrals

In the Referrals section of the app (Settings → Referral Code), you can:

* Create your own referral code and start earning.
* Enter a friend’s code and start saving.
* Edit or change your saved referral code.

Note: You can replace your friend’s referral code at any time, but cannot leave the field blank once a code has been entered.
{% endhint %}
