# Airdrop

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is the setup for the current Season 0 and will be discontinued after the current season ends, starting with [Airdrop V2](airdrop-v2.md) to further enhance the airdrop experience. Read more about it [here](https://medium.com/@vultisig/vultisig-airdrop-2-0-how-were-transforming-the-experience-f20c146f2f29) .
{% endhint %}

***

Early adopters of the Vultisig wallet security standard are highly valued by the project, so Vultisig wants to give back to these high conviction members.

The future $VULT airdrop will be proportionate to:

$$
vault\_asset\_value*time\_in\_vault
$$

With the distribution date of 12 months after registration goes live.\
See further calculation [here](./#airdrop-process).\
\
Users will receive full information about how to register for this airdrop in the coming weeks.

***

## Airdrop Process

To register their vaults for the Airdrop, users send their exported Vault public Keys to an Airdrop Registry, which will scan for presence of funds on chains, and then begin counting airdrop value.\
**See the exact instructions** [**here.**](./#how-to-register-for-the-airdrop)\
\
This will include most actions performed in Vultisig (like bonding to nodes and staking, etc.).

A new scan will be performed each cycle (day), and the user airdrop value accumulates in form of VULTIES (Points).\
Users that keep the funds the longest in Vultisig will earn the highest airdrop value.

$$
user\_VULTIES += \$\text{total\_vault\_value}
$$

The final share of the Airdrop is the pro-rata share of the airdrop allocation.

$$
\text{user\_airdrop\_share} = 1,000,000 \times \left( \frac{\text{user\_VULTIES}}{\text{total\_VULTIES}} \right)
$$

## Airdrop point multiplier

In order to make the Vultisig Airdrop more game-like and to further increase the possible reach of the Vultisig Airdrop, we will introduce more possibilities to multiply the already collected airdrop points.

The multiplier will accumulate, similar to the VULTIES (airdrop points) and will be calculated at the end of the airdrop phase to get the complete airdrop share.

This gives the opportunity to increase the personal multiplier over the course of the ongoing 12 month Airdrop without affecting the VULTIES.

The multiplier will start at 1 and will increase depending on the activities and programms, set by the Vultisig team.

### How to increase the Multiplier

At the heart of the Airdrop multiplier is the [Referral Program](./#referral-program).

{% hint style="info" %}
There will be special programs and opportunities to increase this as the airdrop progresses. They are listed below.
{% endhint %}

#### Referral Program

Vultisig team has built a [Telegram bot](../../other/vultisig-bot.md) to easily invite friends and track the referred people.

* Invite people
* Let them install Vultisig
* Funding the wallet with at least $50 of assets
* **Increase your referral count and airdrop share**

**The referred people will have a strong impact on the multiplier.**
