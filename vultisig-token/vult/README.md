## Utility of $VULT token

The main benefit lies in the various mechanisms provided, through which $VULT holders receive discounts and other benefits for holding $VULT.

In general, VULT will unlock trading fee discounts, voting rights, preferential pricing, and exclusive access to premium features across the Vultisig marketplace. As our ecosystem grows, the utility and value of holding VULT tokens will increase as well.

All current and future utility is aimed at driving value to the VULT token, displaying the project's current adoption and value accrual.

The Utility is separated into 3 pillars:

* In-App Utility
* App Store Utility
* Governance Utility

***

### Value Accrual

All value generated in the Vultisig ecosystem is designed to flow back into the $VULT token, this consists mainly of fee revenue and other income streams.

<table><thead><tr><th width="373">Fee</th><th>Amount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Swap Fees (Cross-chain and Token swaps)</td><td>Starting at 50 basis points</td></tr><tr><td>Bridge Fees (Between EVMs and IBC, to be implemented)</td><td>10 basis points</td></tr><tr><td>Marketplace Fees (Plugins and Ai Agents)</td><td>30% of generated revenue</td></tr></tbody></table>

***

### Token Buybacks

All fees generated by Vultisig products will be used to buy back $VULT tokens periodically.

This reduces the circulating supply and has a direct positive impact on the token itself depending on the adoption and usage of Vultisig products, like the apps and the app store.

The bought back [$VULT](https://x.com/search?q=%24VULT\&src=cashtag_click) tokens will be held in the fee treasury until the distribution mechanism are determined and set in place.
