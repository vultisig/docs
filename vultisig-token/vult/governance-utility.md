# Governance Utility

Vultisig will gradually transition to a governance voting structure owned by the community, which will utilize staked $VULT. This structure will decide how to allocate the bought-back $VULT.

This transition will happen gradually. During this time, we will continue to buy back $VULT with the accumulated revenue.&#x20;

This will enable us to act in the project’s best interest and avoid regulatory issues, providing an interesting and fair distribution structure. The exact governance structure and voting options will be decided in the near future.
