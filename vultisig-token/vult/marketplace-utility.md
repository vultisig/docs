# Marketplace Utility

{% hint style="info" %}
The Marketplace is not yet fully rolled out. The exact fees for each category are still to be determined. They will be updated as soon as they are finalized.
{% endhint %}

## **Developer and Plugin Registration Fee**

To improve plugin quality and prevent malicious plugins on the Marketplace, Vultisig developers will pay a one-time registration fee and a per-plugin registration fee in [$VULT](https://x.com/search?q=%24VULT\&src=cashtag_click), which will be burned. \
This system provides better oversight of developers in the Vultisig ecosystem.

***

## **Reduced Fees for Users**

Users will be able to pay with [$VULT](https://x.com/search?q=%24VULT\&src=cashtag_click) instead of [$USDC](https://x.com/search?q=%24USDC\&src=cashtag_click) and receive a discount on installation fees in the Marketplace. Additionally, users will receive reduced fees on recurring purchases, such as subscriptions or bulk purchases, when staking [$VULT](https://x.com/search?q=%24VULT\&src=cashtag_click). The exact amounts are yet to be determined before the complete Marketplace rollout.

***

## **Premium Plugins**

Developers can apply for a "Premium Plugin" or "Vultisig Approved" label. This will incur a one-time fee in VULT, which will be considered revenue. The Vultisig team will audit and perform a regression test on the developer's plugin, which will increase the credibility of the plugin.

***

## **Boost Visibility**

Developers will be able to increase their visibility in the Marketplace by spending [$VULT](https://x.com/search?q=%24VULT\&src=cashtag_click) . The specific packages will be determined before the Marketplace rollout.

***

## **Developer Income Boost**

Developers will be able to stake and lock up tokens to increase their share of the fees. Stake and Lock:

* 500.000 VULT for 1 year, receive 80% of fees
* 1.000.000 VULT for 1 year, receive 90% of fees

These will be one-year subscriptions and will be available at a later point, after the Marketplace rollout.
