# What is a Vultisigner

Vultisigner is a feature of Vultisig that allows for the automatic co-signing of transactions within a user's Vault, but only under pre-defined parameters set by the Vault owner. \
It acts as an automatic co-signer that engages only when specific user-defined criterias are met.

This functionality allows users to manage a Vultisig vault that inherently operates as a multi-device, multi-factor vault while providing the user experience of a single-signature wallet when signing transactions. Particularly in a 2-of-2 Vault configuration. \
When used in a 2-of-3 setup, it significantly enhances security due to the added transaction policies.&#x20;

Therefore the Vultisigner feature ensures that funds undergo automatic security checks that are consistently met once configured. These features can be modified by obtaining the threshold majority of vault shares and signing a transaction, offering flexibility in maintaining and updating security protocols.
